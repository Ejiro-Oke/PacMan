Challenge from Srimba

My recreation of PacMAn is a "vanilla javaScript" game with HTML and CSS


 PacMan moves around the grid, eating pacdots, powerpellets, and scared ghosts while avoiding walls. Here are the Javascript functions implemented to make that happen:
* addEventListener()
* getElementById()
* querySelector()
* for Loop
* appendChild()
* createElement()
* push()
* Switch statements
* classList
* switch case
* keyCode
* forEach()
* setTimeout
* Classes
* constructors
* setInterval()
* removeEventListener
* Custom functions.
